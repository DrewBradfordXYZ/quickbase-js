What I’m Trying to Do
My approach is to ensure AppsApi.ts is generated with getAppById so QuickbaseClient.ts can map it to client.getApp. Steps include:
Fix fix-spec.ts:
Add tags: ["Apps"] to /apps/* endpoints to group them into AppsApi.ts.

Ensure all endpoints and models are correctly defined and typed.

Debug regenerate-client.ts:
Enhance logging to catch why AppsApi.ts isn’t generated.

Test if getAppById appears in another file (e.g., DefaultApi.ts).

Update QuickbaseClient.ts:
Adjust imports to use the correct API class once generated.

Test and Iterate:
Run npm run fix-spec, npm run regenerate, and npm run test to verify AppsApi.ts exists and test.ts works.

The latest fix-spec.ts with tags aims to force the generator to create AppsApi.ts, addressing the missing file issue.
Relevant Project Files
Here’s a list of files that would help understand and resolve this problem, along with their roles:
src/code-generation/fix-spec.ts:
Role: Modifies the original QuickBase spec (e.g., QuickBase_RESTful_*.json) to create quickbase-fixed.json with required endpoints (e.g., /apps/{appId}).

Relevance: Defines the spec fed to the generator; errors here affect generation.

src/code-generation/quickbase-fixed.json:
Role: The processed OpenAPI spec used by regenerate-client.ts to generate code.

Relevance: Confirms if /apps/{appId} is correctly structured with operationId: "getAppById".

src/code-generation/regenerate-client.ts:
Role: Runs OpenAPI Generator to produce src/generated/ files (APIs and models) and fixes .ts extensions with ts-morph.

Relevance: Controls the generation process; logs reveal why AppsApi.ts is missing.

src/generated/apis/AppsApi.ts (if exists):
Role: Should contain getAppById method for /apps/{appId} GET.

Relevance: Missing file is the core issue; its absence breaks QuickbaseClient.ts.

src/generated/apis/DefaultApi.ts:
Role: Default API class for untagged operations.

Relevance: Might contain getAppById if tags are misconfigured.

src/QuickbaseClient.ts:
Role: Wraps generated API classes (e.g., AppsApi) in a Proxy for ergonomic calls (e.g., client.getApp).

Relevance: Fails to import AppsApi.ts, causing the runtime error.

src/test.ts:
Role: Test script calling client.getApp({ appId }).

Relevance: Final validation point; shows if the fix works.

.env.development:
Role: Stores QB_REALM, QB_USER_TOKEN, QB_APP_ID for API authentication.

Relevance: Ensures the API call has valid credentials (not the current issue, but critical for success).

src/specs/QuickBase_RESTful_API_2025-03-04T06_22_39.725Z.json (or similar):
Role: Original QuickBase API spec before fix-spec.ts processing.

Relevance: Shows how /apps/{appId} was originally defined, helping identify conflicts.

package.json:
Role: Defines scripts (fix-spec, regenerate, test) and dependencies (e.g., ts-node, openapi-generator-cli).

Relevance: Confirms script commands and versions align with our process.




What We Achieved
Goal Met: You can now call client.getApp({ appId: "buwai2zpe" }) and get the app details { id: 'buwai2zpe', name: 'qb-copy' }.

Fixes Applied:
Added tags: ["Apps"] in fix-spec.ts to ensure AppsApi.ts is generated with getAppById.

Updated QuickbaseClient.ts to:
Use prototype methods via Object.getOwnPropertyNames.

Bind methods to preserve context with .bind(api).

Handle getAppById’s direct JSON return instead of a Response object.

Result: The ergonomic API you wanted (client.getApp) works seamlessly with the generated AppsApi.ts.

Why It Works Now
fix-spec.ts:
Correctly defined /apps/{appId} with operationId: "getAppById" and tags: ["Apps"], ensuring AppsApi.ts generation.

regenerate-client.ts:
Successfully ran OpenAPI Generator to produce AppsApi.ts with getAppById.

QuickbaseClient.ts:
buildMethodMap now captures getAppById and maps it to getApp.

invokeMethod passes { appId: 'buwai2zpe' } as requestParameters and handles the JSON response directly.

test.ts:
Calls client.getApp and logs the result, proving the end-to-end flow.
