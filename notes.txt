At the core of my challenge is to update the QuickbaseClient.ts file with the correct types signatures, removing "any" types.Right now the way I have been doing that is by adding spec overrides to the raw specs/QuickBase_RESTful_API_*.json file by creating open-api/paths/* and open-api/definitions/* files based on the quickbase documentation that override the raw specs file. I think this has been working okay, its fairly manual, and I feel like I am duplicating a lot of work that exists in the raw specs file. The reason I'm doing this is because the raw specs file has been difficult to work with in the past.Please give me a detailed summary of how the QuickbaseClient.ts is generated,

Yes, I understand your concern, and you're correct to point out that enhancing raw spec processing represents a shift from your current strategy of using path/* and definitions/* folder overrides. Let's clarify the relationship between these approaches and why enhancing raw spec processing could be a complementary or alternative strategy.
Current Strategy (Path/* and Definitions/* Overrides):
Manual overrides in open-api/paths/* and open-api/definitions/*

Directly modifies specific endpoints and types

Pros:
Precise control over problematic endpoints

Immediate fixes for known issues

Cons:
Manual and time-consuming

Duplicates information from raw spec

Doesn't scale well for large APIs

Maintenance burden as API evolves

Proposed Strategy (Enhanced Raw Spec Processing):
Focuses on improving the initial processing of QuickBase_RESTful_API_*.json

Aims to extract better type information from the raw spec

Pros:
Addresses root causes of "any" types

Scales better for large APIs

Reduces need for manual overrides

More maintainable long-term

Cons:
Requires more upfront development

May need validation to ensure accuracy

Still might require some manual overrides for edge cases

Relationship Between Strategies:
Complementary Nature:
Enhanced raw spec processing can reduce the need for manual overrides

Overrides can still be used for edge cases or QuickBase-specific quirks

Better raw spec processing makes overrides more targeted and efficient

Evolution, Not Replacement:
We're not abandoning the override system entirely

Instead, we're adding a new layer of processing to make overrides less necessary

The goal is to shift from heavy reliance on manual overrides to automated type extraction

Strategic Shift:
Moving from reactive (fixing issues after they're found) to proactive (preventing issues at the source)

Investing in better raw spec processing now will reduce maintenance costs later

Allows for more systematic type improvements across the entire API

Implementation Plan for Enhanced Raw Spec Processing:
Spec Analysis Tool:
Develop a tool to analyze QuickBase_RESTful_API_*.json

Identify:
Endpoints with incomplete type information

Patterns leading to "any" types

Common schema structures

Output a type inventory report

Enhanced fix-spec-main.ts:
Implement partial spec loading for efficiency

Add type validation and inference:
Detect missing schema information

Infer types from examples or patterns

Flag areas needing manual review

Enhance array and object schema processing

Type Mapping Improvements:
Extend mapOpenApiTypeToTs in generate-unified-interface.ts:
Handle more OpenAPI type variations

Add fallback type inference

Improve mapRefToType:
Handle complex schema compositions

Better reference resolution

Validation and Reporting:
Add type quality validation in generate-unified-interface.ts

Generate reports on:
"any" type occurrences

Missing type information

Suggested manual overrides

Integration with Existing Overrides:
Modify fix-spec-main.ts to:
Apply automated fixes first

Then merge path/* and definitions/* overrides

Create a report comparing automated vs. manual type definitions

Transition Strategy:
Parallel Development:
Continue using current overrides while developing new processing

Run both systems in parallel for validation

Gradual Migration:
Start with automated processing for new endpoints

Gradually reduce manual overrides as confidence grows

Maintain overrides for edge cases

Validation and Feedback:
Compare generated types from both approaches

Identify areas where overrides are still necessary

Refine automated processing based on findings

Next Steps:
Given that this is a strategic shift, I recommend:
Starting with the spec analysis tool to understand raw spec patterns

Implementing basic enhancements to fix-spec-main.ts

Running parallel generation (old vs. new) for comparison

Gradually reducing reliance on manual overrides
